# MELView HomeAssistant custom component
A full featured Homeassistant custom component to drive MELView ATA devices.

This custom component is a fork of the work done by ollo69 with their custom component [ha-melcloud-custom](https://github.com/ollo69/ha-melcloud-custom) and depends on a fork of [pymelcloud library](https://github.com/vilppuvuorinen/pymelcloud).

### Installing via HACS
If you have HACS, you simply add this repository ("https://github.com/parlane/ha-melview-custom") to your Custom Repository selecting the Configuration Tab in the HACS page.
After this you can go in the Integration Tab and search the "MELView Custom" component to install it.

### Component setup
Once the component has been installed, you need to configure it in order to make it work.
Simply add a new "integration" and look for "MELView Custom" among the proposed ones.
